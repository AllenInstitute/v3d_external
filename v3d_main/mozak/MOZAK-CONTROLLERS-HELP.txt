Setup Instructions
==================
In order to use a game controller (PS4) and a 3D mouse (SpaceNavigator) with Mozak, the following applications/drivers need to
be downloaded and installed:

1) DS4 windows program https://ryochan7.github.io/ds4windows-site/ 
2) 3D mouse drivers from: https://www.3dconnexion.com/service/drivers.html

The 3D mouse should not need any extra setup and work 'out of the box'. Parameters to change its behavior are accessed and can be changed on the config UI's
'Configs' tab and the space navigators setup application.

The GameController do need to be configured (profile setup) using the DS4 Windows program. A starting point is a bundled profile script found on the 
DS4Windows tab in the ConfigUI. The text on that tab can be saved to a profile file and loaded in to the DS4 Windows program.
