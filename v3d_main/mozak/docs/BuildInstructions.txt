Build instructions for Vaa3D/Mozak with support for a gamecontroller and a spacenavigator mouse.
================================================================================================

The gamecontroller and spacenavigator mouse code in Vaa3D relies on a few Thirdparty libraries. These libraries need to be built before Vaa3D/Mozak is built.

For any third party library, binaries (and associated headers/libs) are compiled into one build folder of your choice, e.g. c:\\vs2013Build

The DSL library
===============
Checkout the master branch of the DSL library from https://github.com/TotteKarlsson/dsl

Step 1: 
Use CMake to configure and generate build files (solution files) for Visual Studio and DSL thirdparties, found in the Thirdparties folder. 

Set 2:
Use CMake to configure and generate build files (solution files) for Visual Studio and DSL library. 

Step 3:
Build and install the libraries

GameController code
===================
Step 1: 
Checkout the master branch of the game controller library from https://github.com/AllenInstitute/gamecontroller-lib
Use CMake to configure and generate build files (solution files) for Visual Studio. 

Step 2: 
Build and install the library


Space Navigator 
===============
Step 1:
Download and install drivers for the spacenavigator from: https://www.3dconnexion.com/service/drivers.html

Step 2:
Checkout the master branch of a simple wrapper around the SpaceNavigators SDK from: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/3dx-lib/tree/master

Step 3:
Use CMake to configure and generate build files (solution files) for Visual Studio and DSL library. 

Step 4:
Build and install the library

Vaa3D
=====
The game controller code was created in a fork of the main Vaa3D repository. 
The game controller code is implemented in the v3d_external repository in two branches 1) adding_game_controller_code_to_mozak and 2) game_controller_code_from_master. 
The 1st branch is forked of the master branch and is up to date with the latest code from around September. 
The 2nd branch was forked from code that dates back to Vaa3D version 3.475 and the new game controller code from 1) was simply merged into this branch.

The https://github.com/TotteKarlsson/vaa3d_tools repository contain plugin code. Some plugin code was modified in a branch named mozak_allen_institute that was branched of master. 
This was made in an attempt to get them working as they did in the older 3.475 version.

Step 1: 
Clone the repositories from:
https://github.com/TotteKarlsson/v3d_external and https://github.com/TotteKarlsson/vaa3d_tools

Step 2:
Build the main program and plugins using the instructions at: https://github.com/Vaa3D/Vaa3D_Wiki/wiki/Build-Vaa3D-on-Windows-with-qmake-using-VS2013-and-Qt4.8.6
